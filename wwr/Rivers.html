                        Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river.
                        The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people
                        living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in
                        love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
                        <br>
                        Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn
                        sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring
                        ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter
                        from sun or rain when needed.
                        <br>
                        Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the
                        longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water
                        is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer
                        in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children
                        who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                        Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land
                        anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the
                        sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids
                        have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash
                        to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding
                        scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and
                        historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
                        <br>
                        Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
                        <br>
                        Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.
                        This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

                        This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river
                        trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.

                        Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking
                        scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is
                        filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons
                        and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
                        <br>
                        CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids
                        in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a
                        wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are
                        familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
