            </a>
            <p>Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes such
                topics as numbers (arithmetic, number theory),
                formulas and related structures (algebra), shapes
                and the spaces in which they are contained (geometry),
                and quantities and their changes (calculus and analysis)</p>

            </a>
            <p>Physics is the natural science that studies matter,
                its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior
                through space and time, and the related entities of energy
                and force. Physics is one of the most fundamental
                scientific disciplines, with its main goal being to
                understand how the universe behaves..</p>

            <p>Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties
                and behavior of matter. It is a natural science
                that covers the elements that make up matter to the
                compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions:
                their composition, structure, properties, behavior
                and the changes they undergo during a reaction with
                other substances</p>

                <h2>Biology</h2>
            </a>
            <p>Biology is the scientific study of life. For instance, all organisms are
                made up of cells that process hereditary information
                encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to
                future generations. Another major theme is evolution,
                which explains the unity and diversity of life.
                Energy processing is also important to life as it allows
                organisms to move, grow, and reproduce. Finally, all
                organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments.</p>

                <h2>Finance</h2>
            </a>
            <p>Finance is the study and discipline of money, currency
                and capital assets. It is related with, but not
                synonymous with economics, the study of production,
                distribution, and consumption of money, assets,
                goods and services. Finance activities take place
                in financial systems at various scopes, thus the
                field can be roughly divided into personal, corporate,
                and public finance. In practice, risks are always present
                in any financial action and entities.</p>

                <h2>Computer science</h2>
            </a>
            <p>Computer science is the study of computation,
                automation, and information. Computer science
                spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms,
                theory of computation, information theory and automation)
                to practical disciplines (including the design and
                implementation of hardware and software). Computer science
                is generally considered an area of academic research
                and distinct from computer programming.</p>
