                <p>Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes such
                    topics as numbers (arithmetic, number theory),
                    formulas and related structures (algebra), shapes
                    and the spaces in which they are contained (geometry),
                    and quantities and their changes (calculus and analysis)</p>

                <p>Physics is the natural science that studies matter,
                    its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior
                    through space and time, and the related entities of energy
                    and force. Physics is one of the most fundamental
                    scientific disciplines, with its main goal being to
                    understand how the universe behaves..</p>

                <p>Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties

                    that covers the elements that make up matter to the
                    compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions:
                    their composition, structure, properties, behavior

                <h2>Biology</h2>
                <p>Biology is the scientific study of life. For instance, all organisms are
                    made up of cells that process hereditary information
                    encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to
                    future generations. Another major theme is evolution,
                    which explains the unity and diversity of life.
                    Energy processing is also important to life as it allows
                    organisms to move, grow, and reproduce. Finally, all
                    organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments.</p>

                <h2>Finance</h2>
                <p>Finance is the study and discipline of money, currency
                    and capital assets. It is related with, but not
                    synonymous with economics, the study of production,
                    distribution, and consumption of money, assets,
                    goods and services. Finance activities take place
                    in financial systems at various scopes, thus the
                    field can be roughly divided into personal, corporate,
                    and public finance. In practice, risks are always present
                    in any financial action and entities.</p>

                <h2>Computer science</h2>
                <p>Computer science is the study of computation,
                    automation, and information. Computer science
                    spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms,
                    theory of computation, information theory and automation)
                    to practical disciplines (including the design and
                    implementation of hardware and software). Computer science
                    is generally considered an area of academic research
                    and distinct from computer programming.</p>
